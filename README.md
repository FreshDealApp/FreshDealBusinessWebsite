## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=18.x)
- npm (>=9.x) or Yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/FreshDealBusinessWebsite.git
cd FreshDealBusinessWebsite

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the App

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Environment Configuration

By default, the app uses the base API URL defined in `src/redux/Api/apiService.ts`:

```ts
export const API_BASE_URL = 'https://freshdealbackend.azurewebsites.net/v1';
```

To point to a local or alternative backend, update that constant or create a `.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
```

And reference it in `vite.config.ts` or your API service.

```

## API Integration

All server communication is handled via Axios. Authentication tokens are stored in `localStorage` and sent in headers automatically. Example API modules are in `src/redux/Api/`:

- `userApi.ts` for login, register, logout
- `restaurantApi.ts` for restaurant CRUD
- `listingsApi.ts` for flash deals
- `NotificationApi.ts` for notifications

## Deployment

1. Build the production bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Serve the `dist/` folder using a static server or deploy to platforms like Azure Static Web Apps, Netlify, or Vercel.
